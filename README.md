I want to share the last project I worked on for call center company analysis . 

It was an analysis we made some calculations as FCR , AHT and CER . 

All for observing the total inbound and outbound calls and their trend for if the problem is quickly resolved or not and how many second or minutes the customer is being held also the satisfaction rate for customer after the call . 

Also we made a dynamic dash board shows all the agent and their performance well to able to find if there is a problem with a specific agent .
